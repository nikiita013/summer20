This repository contains the reference implementation of the model
proposed in Schellenberger Costa and Weigenand et al. 2016, available

For convenience we utilize MATLAB for data processing and
plotting. Therefore the simulation comes with an additional
source-file TC_mex.cpp that can be compiled within MATLAB to utilize
their C++-mex interface.

The easiest way to reproduce the figures in the paper is to simply run
the Create_Data() function in the "Figures" folder within MATLAB,
assuming the mex interface is set up. Afterwards simply run the
respective plot functions for the different figures.

Please note that due to the stochastic nature of the simulation the
time series will differ.
