**Anwar2013_stochasticCalcium**
Model by [Anwer et. al. 2013, Stochastic calcium mechanisms cause dendritic calcium spike variability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24089492).
This paper proposes a model for stochastic calcium mechanism which they contend to be the main reason for the dentritic calcium spike variability against the notion of only voltage gated channels contributing to variability.

**Chartove2020_striatalMicrocircuits**
Model by [Chartove et. al. 2020, A biophysical model of striatal microcircuits suggests gamma and beta oscillations interleaved at delta/theta frequencies mediate periodicity in motor control](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007300#sec002)
In this paper, the authors propose a biophysical model of striatal microcircuits that comprehensively describes the generation and interaction of these rhythms, as well as their modulation by dopamine.

**Costa2016_thalamocorticalNeuralMass**
Model by [Costa et. al. 2016, A Thalamocortical Neural Mass Model of the EEG during NREM Sleep and Its Response to Auditory Stimulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008627/)
In paper the authors show that with the inclusion of detailed calcium currents, the thalamic neural mass model is able to generate different firing modes, and validate the model with EEG-data from a recent sleep study in humans, where closed-loop auditory stimulation was applied.

**Masoli2015_detailedPurkinje**
[Masoli et. al. 2015, Action potential processing in a detailed Purkinje cell model reveals a critical role for axonal compartmentalization](
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00047/full).
The authors have elaborated a multicompartmental model incorporating available knowledge on localization and gating of PC (Purkinje cell) ionic channels. This model incorporate numerous ionic mechanisms involved (various Na, Ca, K channel types), since recent experiments showed that  Na-dependent processing plays a primary role in effective regulation of spike generation and transmission to deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN).

**Yang2016_disinbitoryCircuit**
Model by [Yang 2016, A dendritic disinhibitory circuit mechanism for pathway-specific gating](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12815?spm=smwp.content.content.1.1531094400036hOtrcXw).
The authors propose a mechanism for flexible routing of information flow in a complex brain network (pathway-specific gating) with a dendritic disinhibitory circuit which can instantiate pathway-specific gating.
